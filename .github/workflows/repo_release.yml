            # HariKube

            ## What is this?

            Normally, Kubernetes uses a database called ETCD. [Kine](https://github.com/k3s-io/kine) (the origin of this project) is a tool that allows Kubernetes to use other databases (like SQLite or PostgreSQL) instead.

            This specific version of Kine is unique because it handles filtering adirectly at the database level, which can make your cluster much faster and more efficient.

            ## Why this fork exists?

            Both ETCD and Kine are limited by Kubernetes API server itself and how it filters data. API server manages an O(n) cache in memory, and filters data at client side, because both ETCD and Kine are lacking on data filtering. The only real option is vertical scaling of all (API, ETCD, Kine). An average cluster dies at 50-100k records. Of course, you can add more ram, more iops, but these are just postponing the problem.

            By changing a few lines of Kubernetes and a few lines of Kine, this project is able to send filtering to the database level. With these changes it is able to disable watch cache in Kubernetes API, and consumes O(1) memory during operation.

            Here are some benchmark results on Ultra 7 165H 18 Core 4G, single VM ran everything including the k6 benchmark itself. 120 vus, each vu created a custom resource (6 different type) and read it back via label selector:

            Open-Source edition is designed to interface with a single backend database instance at a time, which can become a performance bottleneck as your cluster grows. To address this, our advanced editions introduce various data routing capabilities. This allows you to distribute workloads across multiple database backends simultaneously, ensuring horizontal scalability for even the most demanding environments. Check out which [edition](https://harikube.info/editions/) fit's to your use-case.

            ## Installation: The vCluster Method

            The easiest way to use this setup is inside a vCluster (a virtual cluster running inside your real cluster). This keeps everything bundled together.

            - Step A: Bring your own cluster

            - Step B: Deploy the vCluster

            Run these commands to create your virtual cluster using a pre-configured SQLite setup:

            ```bash
            # This creates the virtual cluster resources
            # Edit .spec.template.spec.containers.harikube.args to configure database
            kubectl apply -f https://github.com/HariKube/harikube/releases/download/${{ github.ref_name }}/vcluster-harikube-sqlite-${{ github.ref_name }}.yaml

            # Wait for readiness
            kubectl wait -n harikube --for=jsonpath='{.status.readyReplicas}'=1 statefulset/harikube --timeout=5m

            # This connects your local terminal to the new virtual cluster
            vcluster connect harikube

            # This creates and admission policy to disable metadata caching of your resources
            kubectl apply -f https://github.com/HariKube/harikube/releases/download/${{ github.ref_name }}/skip-controller-manager-metadata-caching.yaml
            ```

            > 🔓 vCluster simplifies the operational workflow by automatically updating your local environment. For more details how to disable this behaviour, or how to get config by service account for example please wisit the official docs` [Access and expose vCluster](https://www.vcluster.com/docs/vcluster/manage/accessing-vcluster) section.

            > 🔓 For service access from host, the vCluster setup keeps things simple: Create your ServiceAccount, create a secret annotated with `kubernetes.io/service-account.name` (example below), and vCluster will sync the secret to the host cluster.

            ```yaml
            apiVersion: v1
            kind: Secret
            metadata:
              name: remote-your-service-account-name
              annotations:
                kubernetes.io/service-account.name: "your-service-account-name"
            type: kubernetes.io/service-account-token
            ```

            On the host cluster, you can fetch the connection details.

            ```bash
            KUBE_API_URL=harikube.harikube.svc.cluster.local
            TOKEN=$(kubectl get secret -n harikube remote-your-service-account-name-x-default-x-harikube -o jsonpath='{.data.token}' | base64 -d)
            CA_CERT=$(kubectl get secret -n harikube remote-your-service-account-name-x-default-x-harikube -o jsonpath='{.data.ca\.crt}' | base64 -d)
            ```

            - Step C: Enjoy

            ## Important Requirement

            To use these features to their full potential, you cannot use "standard" Kubernetes. You must use the patched images provided by us These patches allow the Kubernetes API to understand the special storage instructions Kine is waiting for.
